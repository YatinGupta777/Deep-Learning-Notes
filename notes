- np.exp(x) works for any np.array x and applies the exponential function to every coordinate
- Broadcasting, vectorization
- Use np.sum, np.dot, np.multiply, np.maximum etc instead of python built in


Common steps for pre-processing a new dataset are:

Figure out the dimensions and shapes of the problem (m_train, m_test, num_px, ...)
Reshape the datasets such that each example is now a vector of size (num_px * num_px * 3, 1)
"Standardize" the data


The main steps for building a Neural Network are:

Define the model structure (such as number of input features)
Initialize the model's parameters
Loop:
Calculate current loss (forward propagation)
Calculate current gradient (backward propagation)
Update parameters (gradient descent)
